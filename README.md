# Tamar Aquatics Website Refresh

View the live website [here](https://jaimiehemmings.github.io/HTML-CSS-Project/)

Tamar Aquatics is local aquarium store near me that I believe could use a website update in order to increase social media engagement and drive sales. Tamar Aquatics has a range of services beyond simply selling a variety of Coldwater and Tropical Fish.

### Design

- Colour Scheme
  The main colours used on the website are a deep blue, a lighter shade of blue, green, black and white. These colours allow me to create an aesthetic website while offering good contrast to improve readability of text as well as draw attention to important sections of the website. colour can have a massive impact on an individuals psychology and how they interprate a message.

- Typography
  For fonts I will be using "Ubuntu". With Ubuntu Bold being used mostly for headings and interactive elements to help draw attention as well as being a sans serif font offering increased legibility on all screen types.

- Imagery
  Images used across the site were carefully selected for their low file size to improve load times while maintaining a high quality to improve fidelity on larger screens. Images will focus on fish and natural habitats of those fish as well as images of products sold in the store.
